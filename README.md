# (*forked*) Smart App Rate

This project is forked from [codemybrainsout/smart-app-rate](https://github.com/codemybrainsout/smart-app-rate) because I wanted to show a dialog before opening Google Play.

This fork uses the same license as the original project: see [LICENSE](https://github.com/Carlosph/smart-app-rate/blob/master/LICENSE)
